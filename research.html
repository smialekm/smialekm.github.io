<h2>Research</h2>
    
<h3>Research Group</h3>

<p><a href="http://smog.iem.pw.edu.pl/"><img class=" wp-image-90 alignright" src="/images/smog.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="59" style="float:left; margin-right:20px;"/></a>I am the leader of the <a href="http://smog.iem.pw.edu.pl/">Software Modeling Group (SMoG)</a> affiliated with the <a href="http://www.iem.pw.edu.pl/?page_id=204">Institute of Theory of Electrical Engineering, Measurement and Information Systems</a> at the <a href="https://www.ee.pw.edu.pl/en/">Faculty of Electrical Engineering</a> of the <a href="https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw">Warsaw University of Technology</a>. The main area of interest of the SMoG group is modeling of software. The group is mostly engaged in research around object-oriented software development methods and their applications. SMoG's area of concern are also CASE tools that try to realize the ideas of MDD (Model-Driven Development) and which enhance the possibility of using UML (Unified Modeling Language) as a universal "lingua franca" of software engineering. SMoG research activities are often related to the field of meta-modeling, such as issues which pertain creation of MOF-based definitions of languages. Other SMoG's research interests include scenario-based requirements engineering, model transformations and software reuse.</p>
